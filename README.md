# Custom Anilist Items
Allows you to add your own manga to anilist without adding data to the site

### Why?
A lot of manga aren't on the website, and for a lot of people (myself included) the time it takes to add data to the website isn't worth it when you just want to keep track of a few manga, as well as that what they read may not meet submission requirements.

### Installation
*To do. Uses NPM + webpack.*
