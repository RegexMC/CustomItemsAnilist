TODO:
	- Manga data seems to be randomly resetting? Chrome issue or writing bad data? Gotta debug
	- Manga stats not showing at all if there are none (Should just show 0)
	- (not all?) reading manga showing up in https://anilist.co/user/*/mangalist/Completed ?
	- Try catch some parts that will throw errors
	- Add ability to set and update word count etc.
	- Clean up code
	- Auto fill creation data based on current page
	- Give preview of cover when creating manga
	- Fix extra stats showing twice (assign id and check beforehand?) - hasnt happened since writing this in?
	- fix stats showing on ur profile* what i mean is like i feel like this is buggy cause it should theoretically show on other people's too
	- option to have manga be added to normal stats instead of new element
	- use https://github.com/nippur72/ifdef-loader to add test thing w/o commenting / recommenting each time. cant get it to work (causes window not defined when loading background.js (var jsonpArray = window["webpackJsonp"] = window["webpackJsonp"] || [];))

Done this commit:
	- Clicking home while in a custom manga doesn't do anything (workaround by setting overiding href clicks and setting window.location.href)
